                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Biryani is a fragrant and flavorful rice dish that’s rich with spices, tender meat (usually chicken, mutton, or beef), and aromatic herbs. 
                    Originating from South Asia, it’s a one-pot dish that combines layers of cooked rice and marinated meat, typically cooked in a sealed pot to infuse all the flavors together. 
                    This hearty dish is perfect for special occasions, and is often served with raita, boiled eggs, or a side salad.

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                
                <h3>1. Prepare the Rice:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wash the Basmati rice thoroughly and soak it for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil and add the bay leaves, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, cloves, and cumin seeds.</li>
                    <li>Once the water is boiling, add the soaked rice and cook until it's 70-80% cooked (the rice should still have a bite to it). Drain the rice and set it aside.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>2. Marinate the Meat:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a bowl, mix yogurt, ginger garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, lemon juice, and salt to make the marinade.</li>
                    <li>Add the chicken (or mutton/beef) pieces and coat them evenly with the marinade.</li>
                    <li>Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (preferably overnight for deeper flavor).</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>3. Prepare the Gravy:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat 2 tbsp ghee (or oil) in a large pot or pan over medium heat. Add the thinly sliced onions and sauté until they are golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Add the ginger garlic paste and sauté for another minute, until fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and release their juices (about 5 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Next, add cumin powder, coriander powder, garam masala, and salt to the tomatoes, and cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Add the marinated meat to the gravy and cook for about 10-15 minutes until the meat is browned and cooked through. Stir in fresh cilantro and mint leaves, and remove from heat.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>4. Layer the Biryani:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) or prepare to cook on the stovetop using a heavy-bottomed pot.</li>
                    <li>In a large pot, spread a thin layer of the cooked meat and gravy at the bottom.</li>
                    <li>Layer half of the cooked rice on top of the meat, then drizzle a little ghee and saffron milk over the rice.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the layering with the remaining meat, rice, ghee, and saffron milk.</li>
                    <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with dough to trap the steam and cook the biryani.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>5. Cook the Biryani:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cook the biryani on low heat for 25-30 minutes, either in the oven or on the stovetop (using a heavy pot or tawa underneath to prevent direct heat). This will allow all the flavors to meld.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>6. Serve:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the biryani is ready, fluff the rice with a fork and garnish with fried onions, fresh cilantro, and mint leaves.</li>
                    <li>Serve with raita, a side salad, or boiled eggs for a complete meal.</li>
                </ul>
