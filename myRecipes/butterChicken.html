                        <h2>Instructions</h2>
                        
                                <h3>1. Marinate the Chicken:</h3>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>In a bowl, mix yogurt, ginger garlic paste, lemon juice, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt.</li>
                                    <li>Add the chicken pieces and coat them well with the marinade.</li>
                                    <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (preferably overnight for more flavor).</li>
                                </ol>
                                <h3>2. Cook the Chicken:</h3>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Heat a pan over medium-high heat and add a tablespoon of butter.</li>
                                    <li>Cook the marinated chicken pieces for about 5-7 minutes, until they’re golden brown and mostly cooked through. Set them aside.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <h3>3. Prepare the Gravy:</h3>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>In the same pan, melt the remaining butter over medium heat.</li>
                                    <li>Add the chopped onions and sauté until soft and golden brown (about 5-7 minutes).</li>
                                    <li>Add the ginger garlic paste and sauté for another minute until fragrant.</li>
                                    <li>Stir in the tomato puree, ground coriander, cumin powder, turmeric, and red chili powder. Cook for about 5 minutes, until the oil begins to separate from the tomato mixture.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <h3>4. Simmer the Gravy:</h3>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Add water or chicken stock to the tomato mixture and bring to a simmer.</li>
                                    <li>Let it cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the gravy thickens and the flavors blend.</li>
                                    <li>Season with salt to taste and add a teaspoon of sugar (if you prefer a slight sweetness).</li>
                                </ol>
                                <h3>5. Finish the Butter Chicken:</h3>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Add the cooked chicken pieces back into the gravy and simmer for 5-7 minutes to let the flavors meld.</li>
                                    <li>Stir in the heavy cream and let it cook for an additional 2-3 minutes. This will give the dish its signature creamy texture.</li>
                                    <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <h3>6. Serve:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Serve your butter chicken with naan, roti, or steamed rice.</li>
